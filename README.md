# Road Symbiote

This is a trained AI and ML project that can take any video of street driving and perfectly mark the scene for road perception.

The AI can use scene clues to understand:
- Driving side (Left or Right Side Dominant)
- Potential GPS location
- Special conditions such as construction areas

A large ML model learns to demarcate all road semantics with an emphasis on:
- Lanemarks
- Road edge
- Stop lines
- Road writing
- Direction arrows

It also understands driving rules for double-lane marks, yellow lanes, white lanes, and more.
